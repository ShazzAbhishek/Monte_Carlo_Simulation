# Monte_Carlo_Simulation
# This content explains how monte Carlo simulation can help generate new data.
# Yes!! Missing data is imputed in a traditional way using pandas in a dataset. (missing partial values )
# But it cannot generate new non existing features. 
# ML model can predict target features based on observed data points but Monte Carlo can simulate a new numerical set of data.
